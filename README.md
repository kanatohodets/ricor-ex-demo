# RicorEx

Sketch of a `riak_core` application in Elixir. Much translated from Mariano
Guerra and Mark Allen's wonderful work in talks, blogs/books, and example applications.

Things to look at: 
* Two services on the ring ("RicorEx.Service" and "RicorEx.OtherService")
* coordinated operations ('ping' in this case)
